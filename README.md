## Table of Contents
## Quick Start

### Hardware 
This work has been carried out using the Xilinx's ZCU104 Multi-processor System-on-Chip. Additionally, we benefit from the Xilinx's Alveo architecture to carry out the experiments here presented.

### Software
For the development and implementation of the hardware accelerators, we employed Xilinx Vitis AI and Vivado 2020.2 as Software Development Kit (SDK). The algorithm was firstly written in Python and benchmarked in
a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) machine. 

## Citations

Currently, we are working in the writing of a publication where we are going to condense all the results and findings of this project.
